# Grind Life – Sign Up Form Project

Welcome to **Grind Life**!

Grind Life is a mock sign-up form for a fictional social media platform. This project was created as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It showcases my ability to create responsive, accessible web forms using HTML and CSS.

This was an exciting project where I also got to experiment with **mobile responsiveness** for the first time, and it was a great learning experience!

## Features

* Fully functional and styled sign-up form
* Custom form validation UI
* Mobile responsive layout
* Clean, modern design inspired by real-world sites

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Git/GitHub
